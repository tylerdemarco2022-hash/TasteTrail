THEBOOK
A native New Englander, Chef Bruce Moffett fell in love with the South. Head of Charlotte-based MRG and founding chef of four restaurants—Barrington's, Good Food on Montford, Stagioni, and NC•RED—Moffett is known for creating dishes inspired by both New England and southern culinary traditions. With the simple, compelling aim of making people happy through his cooking, the chef builds immense flavors in every morsel he prepares and serves—and in this lavishly illustrated cookbook he shows you how to do the same.
