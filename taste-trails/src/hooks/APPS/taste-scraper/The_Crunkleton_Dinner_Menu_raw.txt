Tip the Kitchen 15

Wondering about the cowbell? Our Tip The Kitchen program is a completely optional way for guests to show appreciation directly to the chefs that prepared your food. Just like the tip you give your server, 100% of this money goes directly to the kitchen staff. If you’ve had an especially delicious meal, let your server know you’d like to tip the kitchen. We’ll bring you the bell to ring and give them a round of applause!
