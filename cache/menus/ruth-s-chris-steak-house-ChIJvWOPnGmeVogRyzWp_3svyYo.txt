Bring Ruth's to Your Event
We'll make sure your catered meal is just one more perfect aspect of your event.
You can count on perfection.
We are a family owned franchise since 2006. Ruth's Chris is synonymous with the highest service standards and a perfect steak every single time, no matter where you are in the country. That's the kind of steak house experience we deliver right here in Charlotte, North Carolina. We're proud to hold a Level 1 Certified Green Restaurant status, demonstrating our commitment to sustainability and environmentally friendly practices. Within our walls, you won't have to worry about a single thing, so you can focus on business, celebrating, and having the perfect meal.
Dress for the meal you deserve.
At Ruth’s Chris, we promote a family-friendly, fine dining atmosphere. We require our guests to not wear clothing with exposed undergarments, revealing tops that show excessive midriff or cleavage, offensive graphics, gym wear, bucket hats or baseball hats. Hats and team support jerseys are welcome in our bar areas. Please ensure your entire dining party is aware of our policy. Management reserves the right to interpret these policies at their own discretion. We thank you for your understanding and for your support.
